# UmpleForSublime
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) components for the [Umple Project](http://www.umple.org)

# Usage

Currently this project does not use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) -- but it will. 

Follow the install instructions for your operating system. 

Currently, the supported Sublime Versions only include 3. Feel free to test and report back for Sublime 2.

# About this repository

This repository is only a temporary living space -- in theory -- until the project is merged into the [Umple Project](http://www.umple.org) if Package Control will let me. 

I, Kevin Brightwell (Nava2), am a student working on this as an aside within the [UCOSP](http://ucosp.ca) project course.
